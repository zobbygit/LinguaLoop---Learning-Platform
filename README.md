## Overview

LinguaLoop connects language learners with native and advanced speakers. Users write journal entries, short essays, sentences, in their target language, and the community provides inline corrections and commentary. Think of it as a peer-review system for language learning.

## Features

**Post in your target language** — submit writing for community review
**Community corrections** — native/advanced speakers annotate and correct text
**Skill-level tagging** — posts and users are tagged by proficiency level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advance, Native)
**Language based system** — content is organized by language pairs (e.g., ENG →SPA, JAP → ENG) for more relevant corrections.
**Prompts and Guidance** - daily or suggested prompts to help users start writing
**User profiles** — track languages spoken, corrections given, and posts made

## User Flow

1. User signs up and selects native + learning languages
2. User creates a post in their target language
3. Other users provide corrections and feedback
4. User reviews corrections and improves
